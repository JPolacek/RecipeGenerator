# RecipeGenerator
A Python script that generates a pseudo-random recipe chosen from AllRecipes.com for all you people like me who have a had time choosing what to have for dinner. The user can receive recipes as a text document, as an email, or as a text.

In order to run, you will need to create your own consts.py file that contains the necessary constants to be imported (I did not add mine for security reasons, but contact me if you are having trouble figuring out what numbers are which).

You will need to create a Twilio account and register your cell phone number on Twilio in order for the texting portion to work. Specific directions on how to do so can be found on the Twilio website or on the website for Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Chapter 16.
